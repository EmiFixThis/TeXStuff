\begin{thm}
The number of objects of $S$ that have none of the properties $P_{1}, P_{2}, \ldots, P_{m}$ is given by:
\[|A^{c}_{1} \cap A^{c}_{2} \cap \cdots \cap A^{c}_{m}| = |S| - \sum|A_{i}| + \sum|A_{i} \cap |A_{j}| - \sum|A_{i} \cap A_{j} \cap A_{k}| + \cdots + (-1)^{m}|A_{1} \cap A_{2} \cap \cdots A_{m}| \]
where the first sum is over all 1-combinations $\{i\}$ of $\{1,2, \ldots, m \}$, the second sum is over all 2-combinations $\{i,j\}$ of $\{1,2, \ldots, m\}$, the third sum is over all 3-combinations $\{i,j,j\}$, and so on. 
\end{thm}
