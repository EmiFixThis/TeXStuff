Content generator rejection<br>Proposed Descriptive Name: Common Lisp Quick Reference<br>Proposed Unix Name: clqr<br>Registration Description: Common Lisp Quick Reference is a free booklet with short descriptions of the symbols defined in the ANSI standard.<br><br>Greetings,

The project you are requesting is being rejected, as we have determined that it is a content generating project, rather than a project developing Open Source Software.

SourceForge.net exists to allow projects a development environment for creating Open Source Software. Its purpose is not to host personal content or content which may take up our resources but which no real software development may be realized.

Based on the description of the project you have provided us, your project is being rejected.

Thank you,
